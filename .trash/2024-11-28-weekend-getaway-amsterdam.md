What a wonderful weekend escape to Amsterdam! This charming Dutch city with its famous canals, historic buildings, and vibrant culture made for the perfect short vacation.

## Canal Tours and Architecture

The canal tour was definitely the highlight of my trip. Seeing the city from the water gives you a completely different perspective of the beautiful 17th-century architecture that lines the waterways.

## Bike Culture

Everyone in Amsterdam rides bikes! I rented one for the day and it was such a fun way to explore the city like a local. The dedicated bike lanes make it safe and easy to get around.

## Food and Markets

The local markets were amazing - especially the cheese market! I tried so many different varieties of Dutch cheese. And don't get me started on the stroopwafels...

Looking forward to returning in spring when the tulips are in bloom!
